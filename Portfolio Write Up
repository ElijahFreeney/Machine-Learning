This doc will serve as a summary of the technical skills that I have developed through my portfolio.

  This portfolio is the representation of my semester in CS 4375 at UT Dallas with Professor Mazidi. 
 The semester can be divided into two sections split between R and Python, where we learned how to 
 implment a collection of concepets and ML algorithms. Projects included both individual and 
 collaborative efforts.
 
  Skills developed and sharpened in this course. Top of mind are the collaborative soft needed to 
  manage a project with 4 other teammates with conflicting schedules and experiences. This required
  effective delegation of tasks. Delegation helped to leverage each members strengths and interests
  as most like myself were unfamiliar with the languages prior to the course. In addition to soft 
  skills, the course provided me an opportunity to study Python and R. 
  
  Following the course I am only more understanding of the potential of machine learning and truly 
  aspire to continue deepening my grasp of the study. My immediate interests align with my job in 
  real estate investments. Given the appropriate data, I am excited to leverage my new skills to
  grow as an investment analyst in multifamily real estate. An industry where operational efficiency
  directly translates to better living conditions, fulfilling retirements, with additional tax funding
  to education public health.
